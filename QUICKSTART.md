### 1. Start the Server

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```
This installs all necessary packages and starts the server.

The server will be reachable at `http://localhost:8080`

### 2. Load the Plugin in Roblox Studio
### Option A: (Reccomended)
Install the official plugin:

[Here!](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/109193856190560/RtVS-Official-Plugin)

### Option B: (Advanced)
"Build" and use the plugin from source
1. Open **Any Instance** in Roblox Studio 
2. In **ServerStorage**, create a **Folder** named "RtVS-Plugin"
3. Inside that folder, create:
   - A **ModuleScript** named "deserializer" - paste contents of `/plugin/deserializer.lua`
   - A **Script** named "main" - paste contents of `/plugin/main.lua`

4. Right-click the "RtVS-Plugin" folder
5. Select **"Save as Local Plugin..."**
6. Save it as "RtVS"
7. Restart Roblox Studio

**See `/plugin/README.md` for detailed installation instructions.**

### 3. Use the Plugin

You'll see three buttons in the **"RtVS Sync"** toolbar:

###  **"Full Sync"** - Roblox Studio -> File System (FULL OVERWRITE!)

This is used when first opening a studio project with RtVS and you need to write all the studio info directly to your editing path.

1. Click once to initiate the verification process
2. Click again within 3 seconds to verify you do want to **overwrite the entire directory** 
3. Wait for the files to sync

### **"Prioritize Server"** - Toggle Files → Studio sync
0. Check and make sure **"Prioritize Client"** is disabled.
1. Click to enable automatic file watching (button highlights)
2. Edit any synced `.lua` file in your code editor
3. Save the file
4. Changes appear in Studio within 2-5 seconds!

### **"Prioritize Client"** - Toggle Studio → Files sync
0. Check and make sure **"Prioritize Server"** is disabled.
1. Click to enable the plugin to sync script and object changes to the server in near real-time
2. Edit any script in your editor
3. Changes appear in files within 2-5 seconds!

### Use of AI
As much as I despise AI and how it's destroying creative work, I think there's use in it for inteligent reptitve tasks such as writing documentation.

This document was originally generated by an agent and has been **heavily** edited and proof-read by myself to ensure it's accurate and helpful.

If you'd like to re-write it yourself or make changes, feel free to open a PR.
